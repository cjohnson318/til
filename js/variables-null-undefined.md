# Variables: `null`, `undefined`

**TL;DR: Use `null` to mean, "nothing", and `undefined` to mean "not declared yet".**

`null` means that a value is missing or absent. This is analogous to Python's idea of `None`.

`undefined` means that a value was never declared for that variable, that the variable was never initialized with any data.

`null` means missing, `undefined` means never existed. Put another way, the Zodiac Killer is/was *missing*, but the Slender Man *never existed*.
