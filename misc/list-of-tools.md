# List of Tools

This is a list of projects and tools that I'd like to learn more about.

  - [Do It](https://pydoit.org) is a more Pythonic `make`.
  - [Toga](https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python native, OS native, cross platform GUI toolkit.
  - [Shiv](https://shiv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a command line utility for building fully self-contained Python zipapps as outlined in PEP 441 but with all their dependencies included!
  - [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com) is CLI building tool, based on Click.
  - [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) is a data validation tool. This lets you look at incoming JSON and raise an error if it is not formatted the way you expect.
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
  - [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
  - [Chime](https://github.com/MaxHalford/chime/) is a... chime, an auditory cue that your script is done.
  - [Dataset](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a wrapper around SQLAlchemy so that you have more of a `dict` API, and not a database API. **TL;DR**: databases for lazy people.
  - [Plumbum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is for mixing shell syntax into your Python code... yikes.
