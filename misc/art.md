# Art


## Exercises

Exercises are just boiled down skills.
Each one focuses on specific skill you use while thinking about and making art.


### Blind Contour

A blind contour is when you stare at a thing, and draw it without looking at your paper.
The point of this is to force your brain to explore and examine every bit of your subject, not just the easy or interesting parts.
A blind contour should take at least a solid minute or two.


### Gesture Drawing

A gesture drawing is a very quick sketch of a whole scene at once.
The point of this is to focus on the whole, not the parts, and to learn to summarize a subject using fewer, better marks.
This should take ten to fifteen seconds, so you should do a least three.


### Half Blind Contour

A half blind contour is somewhere between a blind contour and a gesture drawing.
The point of this is to Just Get Something Down On Paper.
Either start with a quick blind contour, or loosely monitor your blind contour as you go.
Once you have a few expressive marks down, finish the drawing  more carefully.


### Notan

Notan is a Japanese term for "light-dark".
A notan drawing uses blocks of a dark color, and the white of the paper, to describe a subject.
The point of this is to help you see and simplify a subject into light and dark areas.


### Limited Value Study

A limited value study is like a notan drawing, but you use your darkest color, the white of the paper and one or more shades between those extremes, up to about five shades.
In contrast, a value study is just a monochrome drawing.
The point of a limited value study is to help you simplify a subject into a handful of values.


## Concepts


### Draw What You See

Accurate representation is the "hard skill" of art.
When doing this, your mantra should be, "Draw what you see."
Looking at your subject, and then looking at your drawing to decide where things went horribly wrong, and then making the right changes, is a frustrating and important experience.
Learning to judge relative lengths and angles in the things you see, and then reproducing those on paper to create an accurate drawing is a learnable skill.
It is also one of the first things people notice in representational art.
People can detect wonky proportions and perspective almost immediately, even if they can't put a finger on it verbally.


### Simplification and Design

Simplification and design are the soft skills of art.
You have to be extremely talented, and very lucky, for people to appreciate your art for its detail.
If you want to produce very detailed images, buy a microscope.
What makes good art good, is simplification and design.
Simplification means leaving out unnecessary or distracting details.
Design has many components, including deciding on a subject, arranging the elements of a subject in a composition, and adjusting the colors and/or values of your subject.
Given a subject, you might increase the contrast in an area to create a focal point, you might darken or blur the background, you might leave unimportant things out entirely, or you might include things that aren't even there.


### Big to Little

Always sketch out the big shapes first, and then drill down into the details.
Starting with the big shapes creates a strong framework for the rest of the drawing.
When you start with the details first, it is much more difficult to produce an accurate image.


### Think in Shapes


### Dynamic Range

Dynamic range refers to the range between your lightest light, and your darkest dark.
Beginners tend to avoid making very dark darks, because they're afraid of commiting to something that might be a "mistake".
Learning to commit to dark darks is an important step towards building confidence and skill.
Later, it's fine to do use a limited dynamic range to make a very light drawing, or a very dark drawing, or something in between.
